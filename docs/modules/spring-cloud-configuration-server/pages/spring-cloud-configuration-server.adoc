= Spring Cloud Configuration Server

== We need configurations to..
Separate businless logic from configuration things.
For example.

* Database Connections
* Credentials
* Feature Flags
* Business logic configuration parameters
* Scenario testing
* Spring boot configuration


== Goal of configuraiton in microservice architecture.

. Externalized
. Environment Specific
. Consistant across microservices
. Change history
. Real-time management without re-deploy

== Some solutions for Configuration server.

* Apache Zookeeper
* ETCD - Distributed Key-Value Store
* Hashicorp Consul
* Spring Cloud Configuration Server

We want to change configuration in runtime. Without re-deploy.

== Spring Cloud Configuration Server

image::spring-cloud-config-workflow.png[]

The config server always cheking for changes in the git repo.
But the client is not checking.
We need to tell the client that "Hey client, Check for new updates".
To have this mechanism you need `actuator`. Basically actuator opens up certain usefull endpoints for our application.
One of the happens to be /refresh endpoint.
You need to hit the /refresh endpoint with post to refresh your client values.

Also you need to tell "what things needs to be refreshd". This is where `@RefreshScope` comes into play.

== Get up and Running: Config Server

. Create a github repository with all your configuration files named by the application display name like `movie-name-service`
. Download configuration server using initializer with `Config Server`, `Spring Boot Actuator` and `Eureka Client` dependency.
. Add these to properties file
[source, properties]
spring.application.name=config-server
server.port=8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/arfin97/Spring-Cloud-Configuration-Repo
. Add the following into the main class
[source, java]
@EnableEurekaClient
@EnableConfigServer
. To configure the client to tell him that “go get your properties” you need to add the following line in properties file.
`spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888`
. In the repository the microservice properties file should be named exactly like the display name in the properties file in the microservice. So that it will be able to find it’s one correctly.
. In the config server, to check the files of uploaded configurations, the pattern of url is
`http://localhost:8888/<file-name>/profile` `http://localhost:8888/movie-name-service/default`
. To add a refresh mechanism in properties add @RefreshScope in your controller files.

== Get up and Running: Config Client
. Download spring boot projetc with `Config Client` and `Actuator`
. Set it up using one of the following configuration.

=== Client getting configuration:
* Without Discovery Server: Give app name, add spring `spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888/`
* With Discovery Server: Give app name, add `spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true`

[NOTE]
By default the config client looks at 8888 port for configuraiton. If you just add the `config client` dependencey
it will start looking.


=== Serving configurations from config server
* To have a microservice-sepcific configuration the naming convention is `microservicename.yml`. If you put the
microservice name in the configuration file name. You'll get it.
[NOTE]
Hirarachy local bootstrap.yml < app.prop < remote app.prop < microservice.prop
* The git repo config file will overwrite the local config files.

== Special Spring Boot Actuator Endpoint to get all configuration values

[source, xml]
.pom.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

[NOTE]
Spring boot actuator doesn't open all the endpoints by default for security reasons.
So you have to tell it explicetly to open sensitive endpoints. It is not reccomended for production,
only for testing perposes.

To expose all the endpoints (add the *)
[source, properties]
.pom.xml
management.endponts.web.exposure.include=*

Go to `http://localhost:8080/actuator/configprops` to see all the properties.

Reference: https://youtu.be/z8kfFbfGGME[ConfigurationProperties explained]

[NOTE]
Remember to include `Spring Boot Actuator` when initializing your project.

== Config Server Rest Endpoints
=== Parts: `application, profile, branch`
image::rest-endpoint-part.png[]
==== Way 1
* Get -> {application}/{profile}[/label or branch]
* Get -> myapp/prod/v2
* Get -> myapp/dev/master
* Get -> myapp/default

==== Way 2
* Get-> /{application}-{profile}.(yml | properties)
* Get-> /myapp-dev.yml
* Get-> /myapp-prod.properties
* Get-> /myapp-default.properties

==== Way 3
* Get-> /{label}/{application}-{profile}.(yml | properties)
* Get-> /master/myapp-dev.yml
* Get-> /v2/myapp-prod.properties
* Get-> /master/myapp-default.properties

== Configuration file hierarchy:
. Apllication.properties -> Root Properties file, it applies to all microservices.
. Microservice.properties -> Microservice based properties file, takes properties from the root file and overrides them, also adds additional properties.
. Microservice-profile.properties -> Active Profile Properties file, prod, qa, dev properties file. It takes from the root and app properties file and overrides the properties and adds additional properties into it.

The top one will get overridden by the later ones.

. *Default Spring Properties.*
. @PropertySource annotation on your @Configuration classes.
. *application.properties file inside jar.*
. *application.properties file outside jar.*
. *profile specific applicatoin.properties file inside jar.*
. *profile specific application.propertiesfile outside jar.*
. *OS environment variables.*
. *Java System properties (System.getProperties())*
. JNDI attributes from java:com/env
. ServletContext init parameters.
. ServletConfig init parameters.
. Properties from Spring_APPLICATION_JSON
. *Command Line Arguments.*
. properties attribute on your test. Avialbale @Spring Boot Test.
. @TestPropertySource
. Devtools global settings properties.

== @Value
The value inside @Value annotation will be assigned to the greetings string variable.

.plain simple text
[source, java]
@Value("Hello World")
private String greeting;

.value from properties file
[source, java]
@Value("${my.greeting.message}")
private String greeting;

.default value
[source, java]
@Value("${my.greeting.message: default value}")
private String greeting;

.list of values
[source, properties]
my.list.values=One, Two, Three

[source, java]
@Value("${my.greeting.message: default value}")
private List<String> listOfValues;

.key-valu pair
[source, properties]
dbValues={connectionString: 'http://___', userName: 'foo', password: 'pass'}

[source, java]
@Value("#${dbValues}")
private Map<String, String> dbValues;

What '#' before '$' does is that treat the inside of $ as SPeL. It's telling that 'I want the
rest to be evaluated and assigned as my vairable'

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFQDqEhx2e0&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTaoaVoQVfRJPqvNTCjcTvJB&index=5[Three Value annotation tricks you should know]

== Get a group of configuration at once using @ConfigurationProperties
Have a class and will be populated by all certain kinds of properties.

[NOTE]
Must Have getter and setters.

[source, java]
@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "db")
class MyConfi{
    private String connectionString;
    private String userName;
    private String password;
    //getters
    //setters
}


[NOTE]
You get type safety out of the box.

=== When to use @Value and when to use @ConfigurationProperties


[INFO]
* Single prop? -> @Value
* Multiple prop? -> @ConfigProp
* Need prop is many places? -> @ConfProp

== Demo 1: bootstrap.yml, @Value, @ConfigurationProperties
. Make a `bootstrap.application` file:
[NOTE]
This is loaded before `application.properties` file. Typically the configuraiton server properties like URI and Name of the application stays here. Read more about bootstrap.application vs application.properties.
. In any java class, by adding `@Value("${some.other.property}")` will inject that property.
. If you add annotation `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "some")` Any properties attribute that starts with
the prefix some will come here, and will look and match with the ending suffix.
Like if we have some.other.property in our  configuration and we have a attribute inside class with name property. We will be able to inject the some.other.property inside the property string and get the value anywhere inside our java class. private String property;

== Refreshing Configurations:
*Caution: Requests must be POST*

https://www.devglan.com/spring-cloud/refresh-property-config-runtime[Read more Refresh Property Config at Runtime in Spring Cloud Config]

1. *Manual*: /refresh with spring-boot-actuator: You will have to manually hit this end point of all the microsevices that need a refresh.
2. *Automatic*: /bus/refresh with RabbitMQ or Kafka: This endpoint will message all the microservices that are registered with our bus and refresh their configurations.
3. *Automatic & Smart*: Via post commit hooks Spring Cloud Config Monitor & Spring Cloud Bus Broadcasting. Git push > /monitor > smartly choses application that needs the update.
Caution: You’ll have to add management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=refresh in properties or bootstrap file to enable refreshing. Hit http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh end point to refresh.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49364866/spring-boot-config-client-refresh-not-working[Read more.]

image::refresh-methods.png[]

[NOTE]
You will have all the log of configuration changes as you are using git.

[NOTE]
`@ConfigurationProperties` get refreshed when /refresh configuration endpoint is hit by post request.

[NOTE]
`@ConfigruationProperties(prefix=”some”)` has to match exatcly with first prefix and the name of the variable needs to match exactly for trailing like for some.property. The prefix will be “some”, the suffix will be “property”. Some.other.property will not work inputting value.

[NOTE]
`@RefreshScope:` To add something into the space of refresh so that it gets the value when /refresh endpoint is hit. We need to add this annotation.

image::refreshing2.png[]

== Demo 2: Refreshing

1. Add `@RefreshScope` annotation to the class where `@Value` annotated attributes are at.
2. Add ``management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=refresh`` to your app.properties file.
3. Change properties at repository.
4. Hit a `POST` request using postman to `/actuator/refresh` endpoint and go to check if the properties are changed at runtime.

== 3 ways to run Spring Boot apps from command line
In production there is no run button like IDE. So how it is run? CMD.

Run maven command: mvn install

or go to maven menu in IDE and Click on Execute a Maven Goal, Select Maven Package. It will create a jar of your application with all the tomcat and stuff insode the target folder.

image::run-jar.png[]

use `java -jar name-of-the-jar.jar` command

Where to use it? if you have 100 micros than you can use cmd to run all of them.
if you need to deoply it inside a server. the jar file is what needed.

You don't even need maven installed in your pc to run your app. mvnw.cmd and mvnw are two files that comes with the spring boot initilizer project that lets you run it without any hassle.
example: `./mvnw install` command will run install command

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le5YjYNYtZg[3 ways to run Spring Boot apps from command line - Java Brains]


== Change properties from cmd.

. Create a new application.properties file inside the same folder of JAR.
. Edit the application.properties file to override the properties file inside the JAR.
. When you run java -jar command. The java runtime will notice external app.prop file and will use it to override stuffs.

You can even override the props using command line arguments.
`java -jar name-of-the-app.jar --server.port=8080`

Precedence.
. First the internal props file will be applied.
. It will be overridden by external props file.
. It will be overridden by any command line args.

== Properties File
You don't need to put quotation marks over strings inside properties file. You can if you want to.
[source, properties]
app.name=My App
app.description=Welcome to ${app.name}

You can refer to any property by using `dollar sign curly braces` syntax. Even inside the properties file.
`dollar sign curly braces`  can also be used inside @Value("${app.name}")


== YAML
Yet another markup language or YAML ain't Markup Language.

[NOTE]
YAML hates '='. But all other syntax are cool with YMAL.
Quotes are optional. But You can add them for confusing values like "*".

The true benefit of YAML is in it's nesting structure.

.properties file.
[source, properties]
Bla.Bla.Bla.Something = foo
Bla.Bla.Bla.SomeOtherThing = bar

.equvalant YMAL file.
[source, ymal]
Bla:
    Bla:
        Bla:
            Something: foo
            SomeOtherThing: bar

[NOTE]
Avoid tabs. Tabs are confusing, some uses 4 spaces, some 2. Use spaces where you can in YAML file.

Reference: https://youtu.be/RUYV4P68hiE[Using YAML files]


== Spring Profiles

One way

image::jar-properties.png[]


Naive Way

image::jar-props2.png[]

You can tecnically do this from our previous knowledge.
This is very tedious way of configuring stuff.

Better Way: Spring profiles
Spring profiles are always in effect. The application.properties file is the
`default` profile. It is selected if no other profiles is told to be selected.

Naming convention for profiles

image::naming-convention.png[]

. Create a new configruation file. ex: `applicatoin-test.yml`
. Copy the db connections to that profile.
. Add `spring.profiles.active: test` in your default profile.

`default` profile is always active.

`test` will sit on top of `default` profile. Test will over ride the Default profile.

They get combined. Commons will get overridden.

image::spring-profiles.png[]

You can do this over and over again. `test-qa1` profile can also sit on top of default and test profile.
It gets the precedence over which is declared last. The last one overrides all the previous ones.

For example, you might have different environement for dev, qa and prod. They might have
different database connection strings. So they will have different active profile.
But all the common attributes goes into default profile. You have technically made one jar file
that can be deployed in different envrionments.

How's that? All these are sitting inside the same jar.

image::cmd-profilel.png[]

This is where the cmd argument comes in. You can pack all the properties in a single jar.
And tell from outside which profile to select as active profile from the outside.


=== Profile Dependent Bean Initialization
You can select beans depending on your profile configuration. Just add `@Profile`
annotation with profile name. Use this with caution.

image::bean-profiles.png[]

image::default-profile-bean.png[]

Reference: https://youtu.be/P91tqdWUHE4[Spring profiles explained]

== Environment Object
You were injecting values from prop files or CMD. But what if you want java
to look for properties values?
You can use this object and then use it to look for active profile and properties etc.

[source, java]
@Autowired
private Environment env;

[source,java]
@RequestMapping("/envdetails")
public String envDetails(){
    env.getActiveProfiles();
    env.getDefaultProfiles();
}

Go to http://localhost:8080/envdetails/

image::env-object.png[]

=== But using this is a bad idea.

* You can Look up profiles *but* it affects testability.
* Can look up properties *but* you should use `@Value("${}")`

== Buglog:

* If your application is exiting with 0 code without any errors, make sure you have web dependency in your pom.xml file.


== Strategy to follow to make configurations smooth.

. If the property is very Specific to microservice and Unlikely to change, put it inside property file.
. If the property is not very specific to microservice and It is likely to change, put it inside config file.
. Specific to microservice and are environment config, put them inside system variables wil alias.

.Remote
[source, yml]
host.environment.port: 8080

.Local
[source, yml]
env.port: ${host.environment.port}
server.port: ${env.port}

* Use defaults in your project to make it runnable in localhost and in deployment.

[source, yml]
config.uri=http://locahhost:${config.port:8888}





== Encrypting and Decrypting configurations:

image::encrypt1.png[]

=== Example:
Stored in git: `my.data.source.password={cipher}ASDKF232lJLKHOH`

Encrypted Configuration at REST or IN-FLIGHT

*Two Endpoints*

. `/encrypt` endpoint to encrypt
. `/decrypt` endpoint to decrypt


[NOTE]
None of the above two options are secure. You need to secure it by hand. Spring Security can be handy here.




*Two options to Decrypt:*

1. Upon request at the server (use it if your connection from git to client is secure)
2. Locally at the client (Decrypt at the client side)
[NOTE]
The default way is Upon Request at the server. To change it you need to set `spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled=false`
[NOTE]
You must have the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) http://dustin.schultz.io/ps-scf/[Installation Guide]

=== Step One: Choose Your Key Type
* Symmetric Key [Easy to use, Less Secure]
* Asymmetric Key [More Secure]
*** Public Key
*** Private Key

=== Step Two (Symmetric): Configure the Config Server

.application.properties
[source, propertiese]
encrypt.key=<your_super_secret_key>

.application.yml
[source, propertiese]
encrypt:
key: <your_super_secret_key>

=== Step Two (Asymmetric): Configure the Config Server
** Option 1
+
.application.properties
[source, propertiese]
encrypt.key=<pem_encoded_key_as_text>
+
.application.yml
[source, propertiese]
encrypt:
key: <pem_encoded_key_as_text>

* Step Two (Asymmetric): Configure the Config Server [Java Key Store]
** Option 2
+
.application.properties
[source, propertiese]
encrypt.keyStore.location=<path_to_keystore>
encrypt.keyStore.password=<keystore_password>
encrypt.keyStore.alias=<key_name_in_keystore>
+
.application.yml
[source, propertiese]
encrypt:
keyStore:
location: <path_to_keystore>
password: <key_name_in_keystore>
alias: <key_name_in_keystore>



== Using REST Endpoints to Encrypt and Decrypt Values
Once you have your Config Server all set up for cryptography, you can utilize some of the utility REST endpoints to encrypt and decrypt values that you will put or take out of your configuration. Both of the endpoints are really, really easy to use. The first one is the encrypt endpoint, and you'd use this to generate the encrypted values that you'll use in your configuration. And it's really simple to use, like I said. All you do is send a POST request to the /encrypt endpoint, and you pass the value that you want to encrypt as the body of the request. The Config Server will use its configured key, either the symmetric or the asymmetric key, to encrypt that value. And again, I can't stress this enough, make sure that this endpoint is secure using Spring Security or any other means to ensure that this endpoint is only accessed by authorized users. The decrypt endpoint is literally almost identical to the encrypt endpoint with the exception of the name and the inputs. And you'd mainly use this for debugging purposes. So to decrypt a value, you would POST to /decrypt, and you would send the encrypted value as the body of the request, and it would return to you the unencrypted value.

== Summary

. The explosion of configuration in the  cloud and the need for a config server
. Using the Spring Cloud Config Server & Client
. Updating configuration at runtime without restarting
. Encrypting and decrypting configuration

We've reached the end of this module, so let's take a moment to review what we've learned. We've covered a lot of topics. We first talked about the need for a Configuration Server in a cloud environment to manage the explosion of configuration that comes with managing a distributed system. Then, we saw how to configure the Spring Cloud Config Server to serve our configuration files and how to use the Spring Cloud Config Client along with the bootstrap. properties or the bootstrap. yml to retrieve the configuration during application initialization. After that, we saw how we could brag to our colleagues about updating our configuration at runtime without ever needing to restart our application server. We also saw what gets automatically refreshed and what requires an @RefreshScope annotation. And last, we finished out the module with a section on how to utilize the encryption and decryption support within Spring Cloud Config.
